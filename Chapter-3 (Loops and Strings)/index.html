    <h2>Loops and Strings inside JS</h2>
    <h3>Q1. Print all even numbers from 0 to 100.</h3>
    <h3>Q2. Create a game where you start with any random game number. Ask the user to keep guessing the game number until the user enters the correct value.</h3>
    <h3>Q3. Prompt the user to enter their full name. Generate a username for them based on the user input. Start with @, followed by their full name and ending with their fullname length.
        Example: user input = "akshitmittal", so username should be "@akshitmittal12"</h3>
